    "### Linking Genome-Scale Metabolic Models with Relative Abundance Data and Population Dynamics\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will explore the integration of genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) with relative abundance data from metagenomic/metabarcoding studies, as well as ecological population dynamic models. The aim is to model and understand microbial community dynamics in environments such as the ocean, where prokaryotic species contribute significantly to biomass production and ecosystem functioning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Integrate GEMs with Relative Abundance Data**: Utilize relative abundance time series data to constrain and inform dynamic flux balance analysis (dFBA) simulations.\n",
    "2. **Link Biomass Flux to Population Dynamics**: Connect biomass fluxes to population models to simulate microbial growth and interactions over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) provide a comprehensive framework for simulating the metabolic activities of microorganisms. Dynamic flux balance analysis (dFBA) extends traditional FBA by incorporating time-dependent changes in metabolic fluxes, enabling the simulation of microbial growth dynamics under varying environmental conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "We will achieve the integration through the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Assume Constant Dry Weight per Cell**: For simplicity, assume all prokaryotic species have a similar dry weight per cell. This allows us to link biomass flux directly to cell counts and relative abundances.\n",
    "2. **Estimate Biomass from Relative Abundance**: Use relative abundances from metagenomic datasets to estimate the biomass of each species.\n",
    "3. **Constrain Biomass Fluxes in dFBA**: Apply constraints on biomass fluxes based on relative abundances to simulate realistic growth rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Biomass Composition and Flux\n",
    "\n",
    "The biomass pseudoreaction in GEMs typically has coefficients in units of moles of metabolites per gram of dry weight (mol/gDW). For our purposes, we will use the following general form of the biomass reaction:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{Biomass} = \\sum_i a_i \\, \\text{Metabolite}_i $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $ a_i $ are the stoichiometric coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Linking Relative Abundance to Biomass Flux\n",
    "\n",
    "Given:\n",
    "- $ v_{\\text{biomass}} $: Biomass flux in units of 1/h.\n",
    "- $ \\text{DW}_{\\text{cell}} $: Dry weight per cell (e.g., $ 10^{-12} $ grams per cell).\n",
    "- $ a_i $: Relative abundance of species $ i $.\n",
    "- $ \\text{Biomass}_{\\text{total}} $: Total biomass production rate (g/h).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can distribute the total biomass production rate among species according to their relative abundances:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ v_{\\text{biomass}, i} = a_i \\times v_{\\text{biomass}, \\text{total}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: Dynamic Flux Balance Analysis (dFBA)\n",
    "\n",
    "In dFBA, we iteratively solve for metabolic fluxes and update the concentrations of metabolites over discrete time intervals. We will incorporate the relative abundance constraints into the biomass flux calculations at each time step.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Connecting to Population Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Population dynamic models describe the changes in population sizes over time, often using differential equations. By discretizing these equations, we can link them to the dFBA framework:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ N_i(t + \\Delta t) = N_i(t) + \\Delta t \\cdot r_i \\cdot N_i(t) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $ N_i(t) $ is the population size of species $ i $ at time $ t $, $ \\Delta t $ is the time step, and $ r_i $ is the growth rate, which can be derived from the biomass flux:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ r_i = v_{\\text{biomass}, i} / \\text{DW}_{\\text{cell}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "By iteratively updating the population sizes and biomass fluxes, we can simulate the dynamic interactions within the microbial community.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook outlines a method to integrate GEMs with relative abundance data and population dynamics models. By constraining biomass fluxes based on metagenomic data, we aim to achieve realistic simulations of microbial community dynamics, providing insights into the metabolic and ecological interactions in environments such as the ocean."
